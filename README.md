I built my portfolio with the objective of having a clean and modern website that displays effectively all of my work, wether it be web projects or graphic design projects. I faced multiple challenges during the coding process espcecially with all the visual elements that I implemented. The hardest part was to create multiple grids in order to built attractive galleries showcasing my work, but with time and dedication it was possible to achieve. I also struggled with the file size of my pictures and had to reduce their sizes multiple times.

During this process I learned how to built a caroussel with bootstrap and how to organize my content in a attractive way. This project was also a good adaptability exercice as even though I designed this website previously, I ended up changing some elements as I went through the coding as I thought it ended up much cleaner after bringing some changes to the original design.

All graphic elements on the website are my own.

Assets used:

- Bootstrap framework for main nav bar and home caroussel.
- Fonts used were taken from google fonts
